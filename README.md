## Full project description
A project created using .NET 6 and Entity Framework could be a web application that allows users to import historical data from the FIA website about Formula 1 racing from the last few years. The application would use the Entity Framework to interact with a database, where the data is stored.

The application would have the ability to import data about drivers, championship, constructors, races, venues, etc. Data would be stored in the database and can be queried and displayed to the user in various ways like viewing the driver's standings, constructor standings, race schedule, and venues.

The application would be built using C#, ASP.NET and use the Entity Framework to interact with a database, such as SQL Server. The application would use the latest features of .NET 6 such as, improved performance and scalability, improved developer productivity, and enhanced cloud-native capabilities.

The application would be designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily navigate and search through the data.

To import the data from FIA website, the application would use web scraping techniques, like using HtmlAgilityPack or Selenium, to extract data from the FIA website, and then store it in the database using the Entity Framework.

Overall, the application would provide a powerful and flexible tool for exploring and analyzing historical Formula 1 racing data, providing users with a wealth of information about drivers, teams, and races from the last few years.
